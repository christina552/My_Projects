# Big Data Retail Analytics – Random Forest Case Study

**Type:** Academic Project – MSc (University of Liverpool)  
**Tools Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Random Forest, Pandas, Matplotlib  
**Focus Areas:** Machine Learning, Marketing Analytics, Customer Segmentation  

## 📑 Project Overview  
- Applied **Random Forest classifier** on the **UCI Bank Marketing dataset** to predict customer term deposit subscriptions.  
- Conducted **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training** using Python.  
- Evaluated model with **accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix**.  
- Extended analysis to a **Swedish retail market case study** (women’s clothing), connecting ML outputs to business strategy.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Achieved **~90% accuracy (89.98%)** overall.  
- Strong on non-subscribers (**precision 92%, recall 97%**).  
- Weak on minority class (subscribers → recall 39%).  
- Identified **contact duration & account balance** as most important features.  
- Retail analysis: women’s clothing had **22% profit margin**; digital marketing boosted campaign effectiveness.

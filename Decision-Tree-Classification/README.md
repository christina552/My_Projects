# Decision Tree Analysis: Consumer Acceptability and Healthcare Applications  

**Type:** Academic Project – MSc (University of Liverpool)  
**Tools Used:** Python, scikit-learn, Decision Tree Classifier, CRISP-DM Framework  
**Focus Areas:** Predictive modeling, classification, explainable AI, healthcare analytics  

## 📑 Project Overview  
- Applied **Decision Tree Classification** on a dataset of 500 cars (features: price, doors, persons, boot size).  
- Conducted **feature engineering & correlation analysis**, identifying “persons” (seating capacity) as the most influential feature (correlation = 0.42).  
- Implemented **tree pruning**, improving interpretability while maintaining ~**74% accuracy** on test data.  
- Extended analysis through a **COVID-19 healthcare case study**, applying the CRISP-DM framework to model patient mortality risk.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Post-pruned decision tree reduced leaf nodes from 25 → 17, simplifying the model without loss of accuracy.  
- Achieved strong performance in predicting **unacceptable cars (Class 0: precision 0.82, recall 0.84)**.  
- Highlighted class imbalance challenges in predicting acceptable cars (precision 0.50, recall 0.46).  
- In healthcare, decision trees provided **clear, interpretable rules** (e.g., “Age > 65 & Oxygen Saturation < 90% → high mortality risk”).

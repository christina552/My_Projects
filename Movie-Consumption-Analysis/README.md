# Movie Consumption Analysis: OTT vs Theatrical Preferences (Apriori Algorithm)  

**Type:** Academic Project – MSc (University of Liverpool)  
**Tools Used:** Python, Apriori Algorithm, Association Rule Mining  
**Focus Areas:** Consumer behavior, movie marketing, recommendation systems  

## 📑 Project Overview  
- Analyzed **90+ movies** with attributes including budget, actors, directors, genre, and ratings.  
- Applied the **Apriori algorithm** for association rule mining to identify hidden patterns in movie consumption.  
- Compared factors influencing **theatrical releases vs OTT streaming**.  
- Generated business insights to support **movie marketing and release strategies**.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **High-budget action films with top actors** strongly predicted theatrical preference (**91.6% confidence, 1.77 lift**).  
- **Low-budget comedies** were strongly associated with OTT consumption (**84.6% confidence, 1.74 lift**).  
- Seasonal trends showed **summer releases** perform better in theaters, while **off-season releases** succeed on OTT.

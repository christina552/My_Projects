# Operations Modelling and System Dynamics Simulation  

**Type:** Academic Project – MSc (University of Liverpool)  
**Tools Used:** Witness Horizon, Vensim  
**Focus Areas:** Discrete-event simulation, bottleneck analysis, policy modelling, sustainability  

## 📑 Project Overview  
- Built and tested a **manufacturing system simulation** in Witness Horizon.  
- Conducted **bottleneck analysis** to identify machine utilization and optimize workflows.  
- Modeled system resilience under **±20–30% variability** in supplier delivery, setup, and inspection times.  
- Applied **system dynamics modelling (Vensim)** to simulate 10-year fisheries sustainability.  
- Evaluated different policy interventions (taxation, fleet restrictions, dry dock rules) to balance profitability and ecological stability.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- Conducted simulation experiments to explore how process changes could affect **throughput and cost efficiency** in manufacturing systems.  
- Identified and analyzed **bottlenecks** in machine utilization and tested optimization strategies.  
- Simulated **±20–30% variability** in supplier delivery, setup, and inspection times to assess system resilience.  
- Evaluated trade-offs between **economic performance and ecological sustainability** in fisheries through policy modelling.
